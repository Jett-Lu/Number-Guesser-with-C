A simple console application built in C# that generates a secret number between 1 and 100 and prompts the user to guess the number. The application provides feedback on whether the user's guess is too high or too low, continuing until the correct number is guessed.

Features:

1. Generates a random whole number between 1 and 100.
2. Prompts the user to enter their guess.
3. Provides feedback for each guess indicating if it is too high, too low, or correct.
4. Congratulates the user upon a correct guess.
